# Sorting Algorithms Visualiser

An interactive visualising tool for sorting algorithms. Built in Python using Tkinter for developing the GUI. The program helps visualise
Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. 

The program provides an UI platform where the user can control the size of the array to be sorted, the sorting speed, 
as well as the range of the data. The program generates a random dataset according to user inputs, which can then be sorted with the algorithm of choice.

## Prerequisites and Deployment
* Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/

The program is straightforward to deploy and has no special virtual environment requirements.

## Program Functionality
The UI Platform is displayed as follows. There are default values entered in all fields upon the program starting for quick use. 
All inputs have rigorous error handling in place. 

The generated data is visualised by a bar graph.

Upon starting the visualisation, 
comparisons and pointers are highlighted with different colours to help the user better understand the flow of the algorithm.
